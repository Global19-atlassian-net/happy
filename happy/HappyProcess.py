        #
        # Note that HappyProcessStart stores the pid of the oldest parent.
        #
        # The goal is to send a SIGUSR1 to the actual process (in the example above, 'watch ls')
        # If the process has not registered a handler for SIGUSR1, it will be terminated.
        # Otherwise, the test process should handle the signal by cleaning up and exiting gracefully.
        # All processes up the hierarchy should then exit naturally.
        #
        # So, it should be sufficient to send a SIGUSR1 to the youngest child process.
        # But, we want to support the case of a process that itself spawns several children.
        # For that reason, the code below sends a SIGUSR1 to all children of the main process
        # and to the main process itself without checking if a process is a leaf of the tree or not.
        # Note that sudo relays the signals it receives to its child process, so we're potentially
        # sending the same signal twice to some of the children.
        #
        # Note that sending signals to different processes is not atomic, and so we don't know
        # in which order the processes will actually exit. Also, PIDs can be reused, and so
        # while looping through the process list and sending signals, there is no hard guarantee
        # that the PID we're sending a signal to is still the same process.
        # We do know that the PID stored in the happy state still refers to the right process because
        # we also store and double check the create_time attribute.
        # psutil also checks timestamps between invocations, and so psutil.wait_procs() won't get
        # fooled by a new process having the same PID as one of the PIDs in procs.
        # If we wanted to send signals using psutil we'd need to be root as most of the
        # Happy processes belong to root.
        #
        # If the processes have not terminated after 30 seconds, they are sent a SIGTERM, and
        # and then a SIGKILL.
        # The timeouts are set at 30 seconds in case many Happy instances are run in parallel
        # and the system is under heavy load.
